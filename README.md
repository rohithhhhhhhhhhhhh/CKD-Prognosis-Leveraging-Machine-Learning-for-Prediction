# ML-based Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on various clinical parameters.

## Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of CKD can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and treatment. Machine learning techniques offer promising tools for predicting CKD based on clinical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of clinical measurements and patient information such as age, blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, etc. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.

## Methodology

We employ a machine learning approach to build a predictive model for CKD. The following steps are involved:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering are performed to prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines are evaluated to identify the best-performing model.
3. Model Training: The selected model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Model Deployment: Once validated, the model is deployed for real-world predictions.

## Results

The performance of the developed model is as follows:

- Accuracy: [insert accuracy score]
- Precision: [insert precision score]
- Recall: [insert recall score]
- F1-score: [insert F1-score]
